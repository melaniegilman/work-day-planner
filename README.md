# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
This is an application that allows the user to enter tasks into a slot for each hour of the work day.  When the task is in the past, the task will appear gray.  When the task is in the future, the task will appear green.  When the task is in the present, the task will appear red.  This allows the user to quickly visualize the importance and priority of tasks based on amount of time left.  When the user leaves or refreshes the page, local storage holds the last saved tasks for the user to return to.
